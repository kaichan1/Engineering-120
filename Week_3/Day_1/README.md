## 4 Pillars of OOP

Procedural programming
- data and methods are separated

### Abstraction
abstracting the idea of an object from which an instance can be derived

### Encapsulation
data and methods are encapsulated privately within the class, but you can still work with it

### Inheritance
a tree of related objects from the general to the specific

### Polymorphism
different objects respond differently to the same input
